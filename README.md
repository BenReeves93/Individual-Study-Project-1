# Individual-Study-Project-1

Hello! Thank you for taking the time to test my application for my dissertation.

Instructions for use:

- First language option is for your native language, so click the dropdown menu to select a language.
- Second language option is for secondary language or a language you wish to learn, and click the dropdown menu to
  select the language

- Once both languages are selected, click the 'Start' button to begin. If you wish to change the languages used,
  select them in the corresponding dropdown menus and click start.

- Once start is clicked, an image and three words will show. There is only one correct word for the image.
- Click the word buttons, and the incorrect or correct score counters will tally up. 

- For each language selected, the words will alternate between each language 

Thank you and all the best
